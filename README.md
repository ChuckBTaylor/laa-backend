LAA - Legislative Accountability App


Problem: 

Many people care about legislative issues but for various reasons don't necessarily take the initiative to find out who their Senators and Reps are, follow voting activity, or contact their legislators.  

Needs Statement: People need a way to know who their legislators are, what they have coming up on the voting agenda, how they voted, and a way to give them feedback in a way that is EASY and accessible. 

Goals: 

* Create a way to let users know who their legislators are: 
As a user, I want to find out who my Senators and Representatives are based on my geolocation or by entering my residential address. 

* Allow users to receive notifications about their legislators' voting activity: 
As a user, I can sign up for text message updates so I can stay informed about my legislators' voting results.
